The OpenGL project I undertook was a captivating simulation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth's interaction within the solar system. Utilizing OpenGL's rendering capabilities, I meticulously crafted a visually immersive experience. Users could witness the Earth orbiting the Sun while the Moon orbited around the Earth, accurately depicting celestial mechanics. Through detailed textures and realistic lighting effects, the simulation provided an educational insight into astronomical phenomena.
